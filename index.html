            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>For over 17 years, I devoted myself to supporting individuals with diverse needs—whether it was helping someone with Cerebral Palsy 
                    gain independence or assisting clients on the Autism Spectrum to navigate everyday tasks.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>My early experiences in Brazil, followed by roles in Sydney, taught me that compassion, patience, and trust can transform a person's world. 
                    I thrived on creating tailored care plans, cooking nourishing meals, and collaborating with families and healthcare professionals 
                    to ensure every individual received not just support, but genuine empowerment.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>Yet as I continued to grow, I realized there was another way to make a meaningful impact: harnessing the power of technology. 
                    That spark led me to enroll in a Software Engineering program with the Institute of Data, where I've discovered a completely 
                    new world—one where my empathy and creativity in care work seamlessly blend with problem-solving and coding.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Each day, I'm fascinated by how data-driven tools and intuitive software can improve services for vulnerable populations—making 
                    everything from scheduling appointments to accessing community resources faster, easier, and more inclusive.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>Today, I carry forward my core values—respect, dignity, and collaboration—into this next chapter of my career. 
                    Just as I once tailored individual care plans, I now enjoy designing solutions that solve real problems, streamline processes,
                    and ultimately help more people. 
                    </p>
                
                    <p>I believe that my background in human-centered care makes me a stronger developer, and I'm eager to see how technology can amplify 
                    the impact I've always strived for.Whether in a client's home or behind a keyboard, my mission remains the same: to uplift others, 
                    park positive change, and keep learning every step of the way.
                    </p>
